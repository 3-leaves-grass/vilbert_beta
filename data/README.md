### Extraction
We use [bottom-up-attention](https://github.com/jiasenlu/bottom-up-attention) to extract detection features from the image. Please follow the instructions to setup the feature extraction pipeline (You can also use detectron instead, but those feature won't work with the pre-trained model.)

I've uploaded the script I use to extract visual feature for ViLBERT, please check [this](https://github.com/jiasenlu/bottom-up-attention/blob/master/tools/generate_tsv.py) script and [this](https://github.com/jiasenlu/bottom-up-attention/blob/master/tools/generate_tsv_gt.py) script to extract feature from image and ground truth bounding box. For example:

```
